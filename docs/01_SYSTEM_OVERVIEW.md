# System Overview

HydroOne is a professional-grade, open-source IoT hydroponic control system. It is designed to bridge the gap between hobbyist DIY projects and industrial automation.

## 🏗️ Core Architecture

The system is divided into four main layers plus a developer tooling layer:

### 1. Edge Layer (ESP32 Firmware)
Our custom firmware is built for the **ESP32**. It handles sensor acquisition, local calibration logic, and direct relay control. It features a modular sensor architecture that avoids heap fragmentation.

### 2. Communication Layer (MQTT)
Data is moved across the system using the **MQTT** protocol. This ensures low-latency, reliable delivery of telemetry and commands, even in poor network conditions typical of greenhouses.

### 3. Data & API Layer (Node.js/Fastify)
The backend acts as the brain of the system:
- **Telemetry Ingest**: Validates and routes sensor data to **InfluxDB**.
- **State Management**: Manages device settings and logs via **PostgreSQL (Prisma)**.
- **Command Dispatch**: Routes user actions from the dashboard to the devices.

### 4. Presentation Layer (React/Vite)
A modern, responsive dashboard built with React 19 and Vite. It provides real-time visualization of your grow environment and full remote control over your hardware.

### 5. Developer Tooling
HydroOne includes a full hardware-free development environment so contributors can build, test, and demo the complete stack without a physical ESP32.

- **`tools/simulator.py`** — CLI simulator that publishes realistic sensor telemetry on the exact MQTT topic schema used by the firmware. Includes physics-based sensor models, fault injection, and actuator control.
- **`tools/scenario_runner.py`** — YAML-driven scenario runner for automated testing. Define sequences of faults and assertions; the runner plays them back and reports pass/fail.
- **`tools/test_simulator.py`** — 5-layer production test suite (129 tests). Covers unit physics, MQTT integration, cross-sensor consistency, regression tests, and edge cases.
- **`Makefile`** — one-command dev workflow: `make sim`, `make test-sim`, `make test`.
